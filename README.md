## Why this exists
I built **Project Time Tracker** as a small, focused tool to capture what I do on a project in a few keystrokes (for personal tracking). It’s also a learning project to practice Rust patterns (CLI design, file formats, error handling, tests).


## Features
- Add projects
- Add working hours of the day
- Track time and activities for a project on a given day

## Roadmap
- Print reports 
- Run a timer to track the time on a project
